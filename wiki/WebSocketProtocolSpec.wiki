This is a note by pywebsocket developers for catching up changes on the spec and tracking discussion on !HyBi. This may also be useful for people who are interested in !WebSocket protocol design to quickly catch up the history of discussion on !HyBi and understand what/why/when a certain decision has been made.

  * [http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-04.txt Spec]

=== Change ===

Major changes
  * Added frame masking
  * Changed opening handshake
    * Sec-!WebSocket-Key1, Sec-!WebSocket-Key2, key3, response -> Sec-!WebSocket-Key, Sec-!WebSocket-Nonce, Sec-!WebSocket-Accept)
  * Added Sec-!WebSocket-Extensions for extension negotiation
  * Upgrade header is now case-insensitive (HTTP compliant)
  * Flipped MORE bit and renamed it to FIN bit

Tiny changes

  * Renamed Origin to Sec-!WebSocket-Origin
  * Added ABNF (one used in HTTP RFC2616) clarification to Sec-!WebSocket-Protocol
  * Changed subprotocols separator from SP to ','
  * Removed Sec-!WebSocket-Location

=== Introduced library dependency ===

  * BASE64
  * SHA-1

== !HyBi 03 ==

  * [http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-03.txt Spec]

=== Change ===

  * Added one known extension "compression"
  * Added close frame body matching step to closing handshake
    * To distinguish close frames among virtual channels in multiplexed connection

=== Note ===

  * The value of Sec-!WebSocket-Draft is still 2

== !HyBi 02 ==

  * [http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-02.txt Spec]

=== Change ===

  * Added /defer cookies/ flag
  * Added Sec-!WebSocket-Draft with a value of 2

== !HyBi 01 ==

  * [http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-01.txt Spec]

=== Change ===

  * Changed frame format
  * Added extension mechanism (no negotiation yet)

== Hixie 76 (!HyBi 00) ==

  * [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-00 HyBi 00]
  * [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-76 Hixie 76]

=== Change ===

  * Added challenge/response handshaking using binary data
  * Added closing handshake

== Hixie 75 ==

  * [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-75 Spec]

= Rationale =

== Challenge/response in opening handshake ==

  * [http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg01198.html Maciej's post]

== Frame masking ==

== Closing handshake ==

  * [http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg01137.html Prevent RST hazard] "Please note: The close-frame ..."
  * Allow a peer to confirm that the peer has received all data
  * Allow a peer to confirm that the other peer has received all data (This feature has been dropped)

  * [http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg01526.html Use closing handshake instead of TCP shutdown] "I think the net result is ..."

== deflate-stream extension ==

  * [http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg04117.html Revised proposal]
  * [http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg04071.html First proposal by Patrick] Compress only applied to the application data portion
